## About Me
I'm a self-taught developer with no formal background, working hard to transition into tech through consistent learning, hands-on projects, and industry certifications.

Currently focused on:
- Python development (APIs, automation, CLI tools)
- Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Learning DevOps fundamentals
- Completing certifications (Coursera, edX, and others)

I believe in **building daily, learning in public, and proving progress through real-world projects.**
